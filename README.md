# VBA of Wall Street

## Goal

    Create a script that will loop through all the stocks to summarize the data.
    
## Steps

  * The Multi Year Stock Market file is too large, the first VBA script was only for one spreadsheet and created on the alpha_testing spreadsheet.
  
  * Modify the script to be able to work on multiple sheets. Saved the script as "single" and "multi" .bas files: [Alpha_testing_single.bas], [Alpha_testing_multi.bas]
  
  * Import the script to the Multi Year Stock Market file and let the VBA magic begin! 

## Result
  
  * Please see the summary table in the alphabetical testing file, you'll find the informaiton below,
